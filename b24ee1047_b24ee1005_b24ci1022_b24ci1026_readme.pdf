# Hospital_Management_Systems
The Hospital Management System is a project in which our aims is to improving the day to day operations of a hospital and managing patients’ information and records. The system encompasses the following core functions:

1) Patient Registration: This helps in the entering of patients’ demographic details including names, age,gender  and even contact numbers.

2) Inpatient and Outpatient Records: It keeps well detailed histories of both the inpatients and out patients with records of the dates when they were admitted and discharged.

3)Interaction of the Doctor and the Patient: This allows users to identify which medical doctors are working with particular clients so as to enhance coordination.

4) Search Facility: This equips library with a strong search item to help in getting some details about patients, their doctors and other related items.

5)BMI search : It helps know BMI after giving inputs.

Our intention of this project is to reduce administrative chores in the health care facilities and also maintain correct and relevant records that are readily available.
